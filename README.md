# Bomb_Squad

Bomb Squad is a mobile friendly single page web app of the popular computer game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes".
The app's web components were built using custom CSS, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). The multiplayer component
is powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?utm_source=firechat).

This game is meant for two or more players, so make sure you have buddy before starting to play!
