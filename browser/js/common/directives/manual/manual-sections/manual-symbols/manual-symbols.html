    <p>I'm not sure what these symbols are, but I suspect they have something to do with occult.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only one column below has all four of the symbols from the keypad.</li>
        <li>Press the four buttons in the order their symbols appear from top to bottom within that column.</li>
